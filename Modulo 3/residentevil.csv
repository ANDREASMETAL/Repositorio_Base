While the game has a few little things to nitpick about I won't even get into them because the positives are so high.  The only bad reviews I have heard from this game so far are from people claiming to be Resident Evil ""fans"" who never even state a single valid point for why they are hating on this game so much.  I have heard that this game only gets good reviews because of the hype which is simply just not true.  It's getting good reviews because fans of the series have waited forever for this and Capcom certainly delivered the goods.  Read one review from a Jesus freak claiming the game is blasphemous and has too much vulgarity in it.  That simply must be the case for someone who never actually even played the game and is just here to bash on it for being rated M for Mature.  If you are that touchy about such a dumb subject matter than why in the world would you pick up an M rated game in the first place especially one in the Resident Evil series?  Nothing disgusts me more than a person who doesn't play a game, but is more than glad to bash it saying that its too violent or that it is just popular due to hype.  Did you ever think that once in awhile hype can actually pay off you morons?  Also learn how to spell correctly and use proper grammar before you write a review for the whole internet to see you dolts!  Great story, awesome gameplay and graphics and plenty of it takes me back to the good old days of playing the original with many of its settings.  If you don't like this game than you are either not a fan of survival horror or you simply just don't get what sets this game apart from others in the genre.  If you don't get into it than you just don't get into it that is all.  Doesn't mean you have to give it a low score and complain about it so much.  For example I never liked any of the ""Halo"" games ever.  Doesn't mean I am going to deny the fact that they are actually good games with a great story and superb gameplay.  Just because something is popular and you don't happen to enjoy it does not change the fact that overall its generally well received.

 • Wish it still had flavor text like the originals.
• You should be able to use healing aids without putting them in your inventory.
• Not sure why they made Kendo such a prick. He was nice in the original.
• I think Claire should look more like the Revelations 2 model.
• The profanity needs to be toned down a bit.
• Some sections in the RPD are a little bit too unforgiving. Like when Mr. X is chasing you in a hallway with 2 Lickers and also zombies.
• Sometimes zombies are bullet sponges. You would think their head would explode after shooting it 5+ times.
 Would be cool if Capcom added a FPV mode to this game or remastered RE2 classic with tank controls.

This game is a love letter to the fans who grew up worshiping 1-3 and CV. I'm so immersed in the replay value, as well. Completing scenario A is simply halftime of the complete story.

Now as a 32 year old this game really brought me back to my childhood and made me feel like that 10 year old all over again, it was nice to have that feeling.
 I only had a chance so far to play Leon A and Claire B I did not play Claire A and Leon B yet but I have to say that this remake is amazing and is better than the original in almost every way ( except the soundtrack which can be purchased as dlc for free if you bought deluxe edition)
 Capcom went above and beyond with this remake. There are a few nitpicks like the game takes place in 1998 but they have some items and other stuff that dont fit with the time period, it's not a big deal and there are only a few times I noticed it in the game (mainly in the police department)   Another nitpick would be when Mr X is following you  it is awesome but there is a couple places he can not follow you and instead he will wait outside the door and punch you once you exit and there is not much you can do about it.  I also didn't really care much for the sewer area but then again I don't like any sewer area in any game .

36,GenuineBruv2021,10,"Resident Evil 2 remake is a masterpiece, it is easily the best looking game of this generation, it has a gripping story and above all it's got thrilling and smooth gameplay. This game is very different from the original 1998 Resident Evil 2. This is definitely a remake, not a remaster but it is definitely the best remake of a retro game out there. This game is near perfect but I just have one issue, that is Tyrant. The Tyrant is very annoying in this game, he chases after you a lot in the RPD and he has an unfair advantage over the player, I say that because he always knows where you are and he is  invincible. He also gets in the way of puzzles that you are trying to complete by grabbing you or hitting you while you are trying to do something. He also blocks you from going to your destination quite a bit but he isn't there for long (depending on which scenario you play) and when he leaves, the game picks up the pace again. This isn't a huge issue its more of an irritation than anything else. Resident Evil 2 Remake has some of the best voice acting in the franchise and easily the best narrative. Overall Resident Evil 2 Remake is a masterpiece of a game, it gets so many things right and only a couple of things wrong. This game will probably be my personal GOTY for 2019. If you are into survival horror or a die hard fan of the series you should get this game.",-0.01544850498338871,0.5807918050941306

AND most importantly, they placed the fans first! Disney and pretty much every other company out there (in film, music, television and video games) should take notes and study from this. In fact, send interns to Capcom to learn how to do things right. Resident Evil 2 is simply a masterpiece in every regard. So happy I'm able to witness this.",0.22965686274509806,0.6079831932773109
38,Hectik,10,"This is the remake we have been looking for!
 Play history: Resident Evils 2 - 6 plus some spinoffs.
 Wow!  That is my first impression.  This game is what I've been looking for after some disappointing titles.  Survivor horror is back, never been so 'can't play by myself' scared playing this since Alien Isolation.  Gone are the guns and **** load of ammo from REs 5 and 6 which to me were more action games than survival horror.
 One thing about this game is the simplicity of things.  Simple as in the HUD and in game menus not the gameplay!!  Exactly how it was with the original but now with excellent visuals and detail.  From the bullet wounds on zombies faces when you shoot them to the bite marks and claw marks on your player from a recent tussle with a licker.
 They still kept the over the shoulder view from the previous games but removed one really annoying thing.  No more QTEs!!  (Quick Time Events).  Just pure tactics whether to run, shoot or knife your way to certain areas.  Smart use of wooden planks to barricade windows in key areas.  Once you get your bearings and consider yourself a badass zombie killer, the game throws in a spanner in the works in the form of ""The Tyrant"".  One mean mutha about 9 ft tall mutant wearing a trench coat.  Looks like a roid raging Nick Valentine from Fallout 4.  This guy is indestructible and will chase you down and pummel you until you're a meat pie that has been run over by a truck.
The only time I've died not due to the Tyrant's bommy knocker arms but actually running away from him into a pack of lickers that weren't in the corridor before.  Trademark of RE games, areas change every time usually when you've picked a quest item (like a key to a locked door ) they will make you run a gauntlet to get it to where you need to go.  I applaud the hardcore players who play it on the highest difficulty.
 One thing missing but don't think would be plausible is online or split screen co op.  Leon and Claire didn't really set out together in the main storyline so I didn't think co op would work.
 Don't have to be a RE fan to enjoy this.  If you love the scare, survival horror and the feeling of hopelessness this game is for you.  Hope they remake RE3 which was my favourite along with RE4.",0.0014105107855107819,0.4783628408628408

The engine used (RE ENGINE) has been improved from RE7 and the new camera angels works almost perfectly (few spots where a bit awkward).
The re-imagination of the RE2 story is perfect, as a fan of the lore i couldn't be happier.
The game is lengthy enough to enjoy it but not long enough to discourage second breakthroughs.
New comers to the series will enjoy it as much as older fans, this game combines the best of being a huge fan-service to the original and offering new perspective to new comers.

Resident Evil on PS4 has lived up to every expectation. The game-play has evolved to fit within today's standards while keeping enough of the original in tact to please old school gamers like myself. The nostalgic moments the game creates are uncanny and I've been enjoying every minute. The atmosphere is dark, suspenseful and terrifying and when the Tyrant (Mr.X) joins the fray, there isn't a moment without tension thereafter. New mechanics, locations, and many surprises throughout are very welcomed additions while throwbacks are a plenty as well. It is highly recommended to get the deluxe edition complete with the original soundtrack swap (which will bring back so many memories from the original). Overall, the game has been everything Resident Evil fans have been asking for and more. The two stories of Leon and Claire are different enough to act as two separate games and the ""2nd run"" mode switches everything up enough to keep it fresh through four different playthroughs.

 It's already been said by many, but this is now the benchmark for remaking old games. Resident Evil 2 completely reshapes and redefines the older game and retools the game for a modern audience whilst keeping true to the resident evil formula, and acting more as a homage to Resident Evil 2, instead of completely trying to replace it.
 I completely recommend checking out the game. The Gameplay is buttery smooth, the difficulty is challenging yet not impossible. I finished the game in roughly 10 hours taking my time and exploring as Leon, I haven't touched the claire walkthrough yet, but I plan to after a bit of a break.

53,MonsterMayCry98,10,"This game has exceeded all of my unreasonably high expectations of what a remake of my first Resident Evil title played should be. The only nitpick I have is the similarity between A/B scenarios but they added SO MUCH to this game that I find it reasonable to not worry too much about that, they altered the A scenarios so much to where you fight at least 4 forms of G-Birkin and see Mr. X in A so there wasn’t much they could’ve done different in B, plus it doesn’t change the story much anyway, we already know what happens, so I’m fine with it and enjoy the B scenario very much. Now to why this game is great, where do I start, first of all let me just say that this is by far the most intense and most nerve wracking RE game to date BY FAR, for the people that are saying otherwise are either people that A) didn’t really play the game because muh no fixed camera angles (and I love fixed camera btw) or B) Went into the game already with a negative perception and didn’t truly give it a chance. I realize everyone is different and certain things scare different people and all that, but speaking as someone with years of playing horror games including the revered Silent Hill and Fatal Frame series, not to mention all the other mainline RE games, believe me when I say this game blows all other RE games out of the water in terms of horror (REmake and RE7 are a close 2nd and 3rd respectively) and compared to the original the characters are much more believeable and this time around the dialogue is actually REALLY GOOD. All the environments were given a massive upgrade, yes it’s a shame there’s no factory, but I’ll take what we got over the environments of the old game. The side characters are given a lot more depth, and people say they miss the pre-rendered backgrounds due to the small subtle details of what went down (I can agree somewhat with that) but there’s is just as much of not more of that in this game, like the woman laying on the floor next to the shutter on the 2nd floor of RPD, tells the player that something went down and she sacrificed herself to help people get away, or the graveyard of people being buried, the showers being destroyed (my money is on Nemesis), just so much care and detail went into this game and it makes me happy they really did what they could to make an amazing game. The gameplay is bar none the peak of the RE series, I understand there’s people that prefer Fixed camera and FPS and I get it, but as far as OTS this is easily the best we’ve gotten so far in any RE game period. The shooting is smooth and accessible but still challenging due to the reticle and the need to really aim to get a good shot adding in realism. This is not only my favorite RE game, this is my favorite game period, surpassing the REmake after 16 years of that game taking the top spot. After this game, RE7, DMC5, MM11, SFV (after updates and fixes obv) and of course MHW, it’s safe to say Capcom is BACK and I’m very optimistic of what the future holds with future realeases, hoping that RE3R and RE8 hold the same quality as RE2R and RE7.

I remember playing the first RE on the original Playstation - that first zombie encounter in the mansion is an experience I'll never forget. Since then have managed to play every single RE in the franchise. RE2 was my absolutely favorite of the whole series not just because of the gameplay but also the story/lore behind it and how awesome it was to play two difference perspectives. I sunk 100's of hours into that game. The remake is no different and actually enhances/brings me back to those memories. The dread, the horror of encountering zombies for the first time. The lickers being dangerously scary to encounter. Hats of to CAPCOM and the creators of this masterpiece for sticking to the original theme and still giving us a powerful gaming experience. This is hands down the best nostalgia experience I've had in gaming in a long time and I can't wait to sink in 100's of more hours fully exploring the depths of what this game offers.

58,FanaticGamer89,10,"Resident Evil is back for real. So many elements is nailed just right. Let me try and make it short and sweet.
 Pros:
+ Graphics - Game look simply stunning, and it's wonderfully optimized, plays well on many configurations
 + Sound - from the eerie sound of your own footsteps to the creepy noises of the undead to the gunshots ringing out in the hallways, the sound design is simply perfection.
 + Atmosphere and nostalgia - They really nailed the feeling from the original Resident Evil 2 while still keeping it fresh and up to modern standards, as a Resident Evil fan that have played every single one of them, I am highly satisfied. And no I'm not just a completely fanboy that can't see wrong, recently Resident Evil 6 did a lot of things terribly and is possibly my least favorite game in the series.
 +Gameplay - Compared to a lot of games that eventually lets you have the feeling of safety, Resident Evil 2 remake never gives you this. You don't have enough ammo to kill all enemies, if you don't board up the windows they'll keep coming at you. You'll have to bob and weave, shoot for the legs, run as fast as you can to avoid the enemies. And without spoiling too much you'll surely know what it means to be powerless, to just have to run for your life.
 ~Story - I consider this element neutral, the story is what it is, it's resident evil so it's kind of corny, it's just what the franchise is known for. If you've enjoyed previous entries I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this. If you're the kind of person looking for oscar nominee performances you're not going to find it here.
 -Cons - It was really difficult to come up with something, yes the game can be brutally difficult and frustrating at times, but I don't really feel like this is a con as much as a ""git gud"" type of situation.
 Through and through Capcom have made a home run with Remake 2 and I desperately hope to see them recreate other games in the franchise with the same attention to detail and passion to please it's core audience.
 Can't recommend this game highly enough, in fact, if you by any chance is still reading, I beg you to buy the game, give Capcom a reason to keep producing these amazing games.",-0.03969622331691297,0.6321154898741104

61,ultimatesoll,9,"Most demanding remake is finally out, Resident Evil 2 is back!
 No need to say much about the game itself but is this “remake” is beyond of our expectations ? Absolutely yes. Resident Evil 2 Remake brings both old school elements and newer gameplay mechanics together into this new installment.
 This game is a brand new one that created from the scratch, it’s not a simple “remade” title at all. The main campaign is loyal to the original one but all of the places we visiting are redesigned. This is a so bloody, scary and so gory game after all. It has a lot jump scare moments. I can clearly say that graphic content is high. The overall gameplay is quite good, aiming is not messy. We have all the classic weapons along with the some special melee items. Higher difficulty is not unforgiving (even the headshot is useless against zombies). Inventory and weapon slots are easy to use, camera is right and control is smooth. The developers removed the alternate moves such as; dodge in order to keep the originality, which is cool for me. Puzzles are also changed but not so frustrating. They kept the “limited ammo-high surviving skill” formula at there which is the core basis of the very first Resident Evil game. Boss battles are not so hype or complex unfortunately. They should’ve been better i think.
 **Resident Evil 2: Lights Out Edition**
 The game has incredible graphics, hands down! Best RE game ever created, but a few issues here that i have to mention; the game is quite darky at most of the part of the game. Yet again, Leon and Claire have amazing models (and of course Ada too) and the whole effects are perfectly done (raining, flame, blowups etc.). In addition to this “lighting” problems, the game still behind of the Darkside Chronicles in certain parts which was a disappointing for me. Some cut-scenes were not satisfying.
Sound effects are not so great but not so ordinary as well; gun sounds could’ve been better that’s it. The game’s newer OST doesn’t give that epic ambiance as much as the old one gives, but it’s still good (the deluxe version let you use old soundtrack if you have it). Voice acting is also great, so you can notice that during the cinematics.
 **Extras & Verdict**
 The game has some extras for fun, but my personal option that they’re still deficient for an AAA quality game anyway. An example,they could make HUNK’s mission a little longer. But this is a Resident Evil game after all, and it offers everything we need in a decent RE game. It still has 4 different scenarios as they exist in the original one but with the slight changes of course. I wish I could see some extra scenes from the original tho.
Resident Evil 2 Remake is a successful title, no doubt it will be one of the most played game of the 2019. Despite some of it’s flaws, enjoy the game over and over. Play on.",-0.006840235938174084,0.5245692566311121

66,Kenmei,10,"Easily the best RE game I've played since RE 4, RE 2 Remake combines most of the best parts of previous games and packages it in a remake of, arguably, the best game from the first 3 games in the series.
Literally everything from the ground up has been upgraded for the Remake. The game has the over-the-shoulder perspective from RE 4  make a comeback and in a very well done way. RE 7 makes an appearance with its menus and inventory system being used for the game, as well as basically being in the same engine. And RE 3 makes an appearance with the re-introduction of Mr. X, or as he goes by in this game, the Tyrant. The Tyrant will be the most divisive part of the game as he's unrelenting in perusing you from the moment he's introduced, which makes traversing the RPD and doing the puzzles much more difficult as there's really no way to get him off your back. It's a good challenge though and makes those sequences much more enjoyable, at least for me, since the game encourages multiple play throughs and, after completing the game once, you'll already have a very good understanding of the game moving forward.
Speaking of multiple playthroughs, the main draw of the game is the fact that you play through the campaign as both Leon and Claire and seeing both of their storylines as they happen, supposedly at the same time. Each campaign will probably take an average player about 8-12 hours to complete the first time through. There's also the ""B"" side campaigns which act as almost a randomizer for the other character who you didn't play through initially who go through the RPD building in a different sequence. It was very well done 20 years ago and they did an excellent job at keeping that in tact for the Remake.
The characters are very well done too. Each story is loving crafted for the modern day, and there are some story elements that have been added to both characters' storylines that will make even the most hardcore fan of the original game appreciate how much time was put into the game. The graphics are absolutely amazing too as each character looks very well done, including the zombies.
Overall, this is a game that's hard to pass up for pretty much anybody. The horror elements are really well done and, if all companies treated their remakes like this one, the already overwhelming amount of them would be much easier to stomach. It's not often you get a Game of the Year candidate in January but this is easily the best and most polished game I've played since God of War last year. This is an easy purchase and an even easier recommendation for me to make to anyone who has even a passing interest in video games.",0.13133838383838387,0.42393939393939384

74,IlyaLakmus,10,"Я начал ждать Resident Evil 2 ещё лет 5 назад. А когда Capcom анонсировали её, я очень сильно обрадовался. Прошло пару лет, и было чувство, что Capcom забили на ремейк. Ровно год назад, на 20-тилетие Resident Evil 2 1998-ого года, я думал и верил, что ремейк неожиданно или выпустят, или скажут что он доделывается. Ничего из этого не произошло. Началось лето, и вместе с ним E3 2018. На нем окончательно и официально анонсировали ремейк. Я был просто счастлив. Но в придачу к этому, ремейк объявили лучше игрой выставки E3 2018. Я чувствовал такую гордость за Capcom, что не могу передать словами. А трейлеры игры я пересматривал за день десятками раз.
 Перейдем к самой игре. Capcom идеально совместили стиль Resident Evil 4 и саму Resident Evil 2. Игра и страшная, и бодрая, и интересная, и с загадками, в общем, как мы любим. Игре вроде 21 год, но такое чувство, что это совсем другая игра. В чём-то это так и есть. Некоторые места ты сразу узнаешь, что в той или другой комнате поменяли. Но есть и совершенно новые комнаты. Сюжет идет совсем другой дорогой (в буквальном смысле). Если тут, играя за Клэр, ты на лифте Шефа Айронса возвращаешься в R.P.D., то в оригинале наоборот, ты выбираешься с его помощью. Не буду сильно спойлерить и портить ощущения от игры. Игру обязательно покупайте. Capcom в последнее время начала просыпаться и делать превосходные игры, как в былые времена.

They took the series to a whole new level with incredible graphics and great gameplay mechanics. The zombies are the best looking and most difficult to kill compared to any other zombie game, it definitely restored our fear of zombies from the original RE.

The 4 main campaigns offer some additional replayability, although each person will probably find a favourite among the arrangements. Hunk and Tofu(s) return, along with a handful of super weapons to unlock through rankings, all offering a decent sized package. On the downside, as a RE4 fan, I feel like much of that game has been left to die and sadly the combat of this game doesn't come close to RE4's, nor does it have the variety of weaponry, upgrades and lacks the specifics of the inventory system. There are also not that many enemy types (which you could argue was a restriction of the source material in a way, but I feel there was room for a few additions). On top of this, Mr X's behaviour can be irritating at times, rather than horrific. Once you learn his rules, there are times when you're just running around trying to get thing done and he's wasting time rather than feeling like a threat. Also for me personally, I found the random head durability of the zombies to be aggravating at times, as you never know if they will take 12 shots or even just 1. So the optimum way to deal with most enemies is actually to run away, which doesn't suit my play style. With all this said, I feel like this is the second strongest RE game, after RE4.

The true nature of this masterpiece is the atmosphere, it's level design, the amazingly well rendered and animated monsters, and the sense of desperation as you try to survive with the limited resources that you have. Despite enemies getting somewhat repetitive over halfway through the game, they always manage to be unpredictable and creepy till the end. The true star of the show is mr. X, stalking you from Corridor to corridor with this heavy, loud, echoing steps, vibrating throughout shafts and wooden planks of hallways and rooms. The survival elements are great and well-balanced. Resource Management comes down to organization, Scavenging, crafting, and making sure that you're always prepared at any moment. If you're not, be prepared for hell or likely even death.

88,P1Falchion,9,"Resident Evil 2 Remake was announced back in 2015 and like many I was excited by the announcement. With the success of Resident Evil 7 bringing the series back to it’s horror roots I couldn’t be more excited to see how Resident Evil 2 can continue that momentum. The last time Capcom remade a Resident Evil was with the original back during the Gamecube and that game was not only amazing but, it felt like it did the original justice and then some. I was a little disappointed to find out that Resident Evil 2 would be a 3rd person shooter instead of going back to tank controls like the first REmake. Finally having the chance to play and beat Resident Evil 2 Remake; I love the continuing use of horror in the series. I also really love how much at home I felt playing this game.
 Resident Evil 2 story revolves around Leon Kennedy, a Raccoon City Police Officer and Claire Redfield, sister of Chris Redfield from the original game. Both characters have just arrived to Raccoon City unaware of the zombie outbreak that has taken place and now they have to find a way to survive the zombies apocalypse. If you have played the original game, then you know the story beats of this game. There really isn’t anything new added to the story other than the fact that the characters are portrayed better and by the end of the game you end up really caring about all of these characters even the side characters. For me Claire has always been my favorite Resident Evil character and behind her is Leon and this game made me appreciate them more and I couldn’t ask for anything more.
 At first I was disappointed this game wasn’t going to play with tank controls but, luckily I was fine with it in the end because it reminded me of the Revelation games. The only difference is that in those games you can clear out zombies in those games if you wanted to but, in this game they are bullet sponges. Even if you shoot them in the head some of them will still be moving. The only way to get satisfying headshots in this game is with a heavy weapon like a Shotgun or Magnum. This game’s inventory system is pretty much the same one used in Resident Evil 7 so as you explore Resident Evil 2 you should find extra pouches in order to carry more things in your inventory. The key to surviving in Resident Evil 2 comes down to how you want to handle certain rooms will you leave zombie alive and only take out their legs so they won’t run after you or will you clear a room because you know that you will be revisiting certain areas.
 The best thing about Resident Evil 2 is that this game captures the horror element perfectly with its environment and sound designs. Every time I was in a dark room it got to me because I knew what was in the room whether it be a zombie or a licker it was intimidating. Seeing how it takes a lot to take down zombies this time around, this is where the sound makes a real impact because you can just hear the zombies steps, lickers crawling, and worst of all the heavy footsteps of the mighty Tyrant. The first time I saw the Tyrant I almost got a heart attack. When I thought I could take him down, he would throw a mighty swing at me and it was at that moment when I knew bullets weren’t gonna help me this time. And while you can escape from the Tyrant, this is where now more than ever you need to stay quiet meaning you better not sprint, encounter zombies, or shoot bullets otherwise the Tyrant will know where you are. Everytime I could hear the Tyrant’s steps I would get goosebumps because he can be anywhere nearby and all I can hope for is for him to walk away from where I am.
Resident Evil 2 REmake is everything I wanted it be and while my first playthrough of the game lasted about 6 hours and later that number would decrease when I tried out Leon’s campaign and what was once 6 hours turned to 4 ½ hours. And as for the 2nd run they took less time because at that point I knew the layout of Resident Evil 2 so exploring became simple and the puzzles weren’t too difficult even with the change up. The best outcome of this game was the fact that I grew to like the cast of Resident Evil 2 more in this game which I appreciated. The most important question for me would the remake make it so I never want to play the original game. The only reason why I thought about this was because while I can still enjoy the original Resident Evil, the fact of the matter is the remake of Resident Evil 1 is so good that I don’t really want to play the original version anymore. I thought the same would happen to Resident Evil 2 but, with the remake not even using Tank controls I thought both games are the same but, play so differently that if a scenario were to happen where I can either play the remake or the original I would feel like there is no wrong answer. Both games are great and I can’t go wrong with either which is great because now I have two version of Resident Evil 2 that I can go back to.",-0.052112017055626104,0.5727158806106173
89,SailorMoon,9,"Graphics and gameplay are so awesome it's indiscutible at this point, what i most like is that the gameplay doesn't make you feel like an invincible superhero like other ""horror"" games the vulnerability really makes you empathise with the characters, the atmosphere is just awesome those weird distant sounds, high tension silences, dark and bloody rooms it all really gets you in the mood, the jumpscares works well and are not surprisingly over used.
 The narrative ,however, is kinda messy, Characters dying in two differents ways at the same time,  character personality and background barely explained, the game doesn't offer a single clue of which scenarios are canon. If you like storytelling and narrative this game is gonna left you hanging just like THAT corpse in THAT room. But somehow the cutscenes makes it up for it, they're feel really important and well produced, the characters voice acting is amazing, especially Annette Birkin, and then we have Leon with his ""Ok"" performance (not actor's fault it was clearly the voice acting director's).
 Generally speaking this is a really good game, i love this single player-story driven games and this is a great but non-perfect example of this kinda games",0.0997544642857143,0.4828720238095238

From start to finish, Resident Evil 2 is a challenging love letter to the game it heralds from. Its progenitor was a flagship title in the horror genre, being a sequel itself to the wildly successful Resident Evil. This time around, we're treated to a re imagined version of the classic game in stunning visuals punctuated by the RE Engine, first used in 2017's Resident Evil 7.
I don't need to accquaint anybody with the story beats, so rather here's the rundown of the gameplay: You'll start the game with one weapon and eight inventory slots regardless of which character you choose. Both will start with a modest handgun and one clip of ammunition. After you get introduced to the game proper you will be forced to fight, and avoid deadly zombies, mutants and scientific abominations, all the while collecting upgrades such as hip pouches, weapon upgrades etc. There's little downtime during this game. Which could come as a disappointment for those who enjoyed Resident Evil 7's beautiful balance between tension and brain teasers. Depending on your preference, Leon's story will be far more leaning on the Tension, with very little room to breathe after you near the mid game.  Claire's story on the otherhand is very generous with ammunition, healing herbs, and everything you could want and focuses more on careful inventory management and knowledge of the area to optimize your backtracking.
That said,  a note to anyone playing this game for the first time: The first 3 acts of the game are not an action adventure title like Resident Evil 4. If you try to shoot and knife every enemy you see- you will run out of ammunition and your knife will break. Your enemies will quickly feel overwhelming as a result. However- every enemy in the game can be dodged and avoided. It is possible to beat the game without sustaining any damage, though it is difficult and requires a knowledge of the enemy behaviors and patterns.
Which brings me to my next portion of this review which will contain spoilers. You are warned.
 The famous Mr. X or Tyrant, or T-00 of Resident Evil 2 is back. And he's beautiful. And he's broken. During my three playthroughs I found that Tyrant is actually quite an enjoyable mechanic after a time. However, he does come with a few problems. Tyrant is unkillable, which for most Resident Evil fans is fine, invincible enemies that you avoid are a staple of the series. (Well, for half of the series.)
Tyrant will skulk around the Police Department searching for witnesses of the Raccoon City Zombie pandemic and proceed to violently eliminate them. This time around Tyrant relies on various cues to find where you are. However- it does seem, I've had an issue as have several others where Tyrant will teleport to rooms he couldn't reasonably be in. For example (The common one) appears to be that he'll enter west office and appear at the door at the top of the ladder in the library should you attempt to move the bookcases. Keep in mind that this is not scripted and on my other playthrough this did not happen. So it could be a common bug that will be patched out later. However, playing on large room dynamic sound from my TV display did result in some confusing chases involving tyrant. The sound would appear to suggest that tyrant is in the next room, only to find that he's possibly in a room below me or above me, with no indication of which is which. Facing the direction of Tyrant does not improve the situation. This is likewise unintentional, or mitigated by more expensive sound setups than I usually use for gaming. After several runs of the game, you begin to recognize enemy patters and it becomes less scary, and moreso fun to run around- ducking and weaving enemies, solving puzzles and beating bosses with no damage. And it seems like the game is meant to reward you with dozens and dozens of unlockables such as alternate costumes, new game modes, a 3D model gallery (complete with usually 1 to 3 animations that you can preview), fun weapons such as a Samurai Sword. There's a lot to enjoy in Resident Evil 2 remake. My short list of two gripes versus an outstanding game full of atmosphere is the reason I'd rate it so highly.
In closing, I'd like to point out the sound design. It's nothing to brag about by today's standards, but it does successfully evoke the sounds of the original game, and I believe that was the intention. The music underpins the entire moment to moment action. Those disappointed by it should politely raise their volume a little bit. The music is atmospheric, unnerving at times, and in truly safe areas, it releases tension and I'm sure improves your mood. The entire game experience was accented by strange sounds of wheezing air compressors, interval ticks, and dissonant synthesizers. It's a 90's game, in a beautiful new package. 9/10. (Don't pirate by the way- the game is worth it.)",-0.034070030663780664,0.5065268157768156

 Technically it is OUTSTANDING, graphics, sound, gameplay, etc. The story is the same than the original with a few changes for those who played the 1998 version and want to find something new. It is familiar, but different.
 This game is not only one of the best games ever. It is probably, one of the best remakes ever made. Maybe only the remake of the first Resident Evil for GameCube, and now on the current generations on HD, is on the discussion.
 The only thing I missed were more differences in A-B scenarios (1st and 2nd Run), and more interaction between booth characters during the story. Probably the original made better this aspect. But still, again, this game is a MUST PLAY.
 Came out in January. But probably, having in consideration Sekiro and depending on titles like The Last of Us Part II (if it comes on 2019), it is the main candidate for the ""Game Of The Year"" 2019 award. Thank you Capcom. Thank you for making Resident Evil scary again. MASTERPIECE.

107,GamerJosh0137,10,"Some of my best memories involve me and my friends playing Resident Evil 2 over, and over, and over again.  We scoured every inch the game had to offer, we loved it.  Naturally when I heard the remake was coming I contacted friends from my childhood, some of which I hadn't seen in almost 10 years and we all got together and started the game at exactly midnight.  It is safe to say that I am a little biased but that shouldn't take away from the fact that Resident Evil 2 Remake is a well crafted, quality game.  Everything from visuals to sound design really shined, and the anxiety I got when zig-zagging through tight hallways trying to preserver what precious little ammo I had.  The map was my best friend.  Planning routes is essential to getting around RE2, and can REALLY help you when it comes to supplies you had to pass up thanks to a full inventory.  As long as you look at something it will be marked on the map.  That way you can always go back and grab ammo, herbs, keys, etc.  Like the original, you will also find a lot of ""files"" that tell their own story, and it was a joy to read them.  Granted, so far I have only played the first scenario with Leon, and I am more than halfway through with Claire's first scenario, but I think it's more than safe to say that this will be considered one of the greatest survival horror games to release, and very well might put survival horror back on the top, where they were in the 90's.

There are no true faults with this game, in my opinion, there is only minor nitpicks. This game brings back the true horror of the original, but with refreshing level layout and arguably the best graphics to date. The combat makes you feel tense constantly, with limited ammo you always wonder whether to shoot or not. My minor nitpick is that there is no dodge button, this means sometimes you take damage and it feels unfair as you cannot get away.
Also with the new game [2nd] there is a bit of replay value as you can experience the horror from the perspective of the other character.

The enemies and bosses were fun to fight.  The cons of the game was that the 2nd campaign was very similar to the first.  So the second time around wasn't as fun as playing the first campaign.  The music was also missing from the game most of the time.  The original RE2 had one of the best soundtracks and it was sad that it wasn't in the remake unless you bought it for extra.  I hope they continue with this horror route for the future games.  It was great to play some classic Resident Evil.  I think they could improve in some aspects though.

 Now back to business. Really scary as a child. I wouldn't call it a remake, it's a really new game with an old-school vibe. I want to note the great musical atmosphere and design levels that create a feeling of inexplicable fear and a sense of danger, where every corner is dangerous.
 Yes, this is the Resident Evil! With secret corporations, experiments, living dead and mutants. Constant struggle for life and saving ammo.  God bless you there's even a puzzle!

 On to the review... From the moment you're pulling over for gas to the moment you are high tailing out of the fantastically designed NEST of Umbrella CORP; Resident Evil 2 Will leave you filled with anticipation and hesitation that perfectly encapsulates your protagonists being played. The true feeling that we love from old school RE games is back and it's an absolute blast! You can tell as you play this game that Capcom carefully and thoughtfully crafted this game. The sound design is top tier. Things as obvious as a zombie, Things not so obvious like the way stairs creek or barricaded doors shift, or the awry music you get when you know a zombie or something is nearby but you just aren't sure. How much courage must you muster before you turn the corner only to find no threats? Then to enter the next room with your pants completely down. Action in this game is outright satisfying with plenty of room for more in-depth fun and more laid back playstyles after you've proven yourself a few times. I could say so much more but I'll leave it at, Resident Evil just ascended with this remake.

That is just plain annoying, the Birkin boss is nearly impossible to kill without wasting every single shotgun ammo and every single grenade, plust many pistol bullets (and I rarely missed his arm!!).

There is almost no atmosphere of psychological horror for which the original game was famous, there is almost no music, you need to buy a soundtrack from the original and still many locations are left without music! Maybe next time zombies will need to be bought separately? By the way, zombies are cheating, you need 6 - 12 HEADSHOTS (!) to kill, although, in all zombie movies, one is enough. Lickers are also cheating, teleporting from the far ends of the corridor and instantly strike. Mr. X not scary, but really annoyng, he is teleporting from different parts of the police station and under no circumstances can enter the save rooms, yeah, a tyrant ... It is still constantly dark everywhere, such as for escalating fear, but this is a rather cheap trick. Ada Wong have a fantastic device, which allow her see electronics through the walls and switch it.

159,Youmustdienow,9,"I’ve played this game all year. No matter how many replays, the thrills keep coming. After Resident Evil 7 brought back the series to its roots, they took the greatness of that game, used same engine & remixed the best qualities of all Resident Evil games into 1. Completed multiple times on both easy & hard modes. Whatever you play it on, the difficulty is finely balanced. I gained confidence to try harder modes because Ghost Survivor had very tense missions that extended replay. If you beat them all, you unlock a horde mode that is hands down the best DLC extra I’ve ever played.
 You need to stay alive while eliminating 100 zombies in a shop at a gas station. It trained me to think strategically. Found that zombies can’t grab you if you dislocate their arm joints by shooting weak spots. Sometimes zombies will die with one single shot if you can locate their weakest arteries. Id also like to give a shout out to the gore system in this game. It reminded me of House of the Dead where you can blow individual pieces of a zombie’s flesh off. Was awesome when I blasted a shotgun at a zombie’s head. Normally it would turn it into a squished water melon, but the hit detection is so realistic that I carved the flesh around its skull. Was certain there was no way zombie could survive that but was mistaken & got mauled by that nasty ghoul.
 Also gave me the incentive to replay the og ps1 RE2. They’ve come a long way even though the old one still holds up artistic & gameplay wise. The story is far more tolerable this time around due to stylized frame work & charismatic performance delivery. Each redesign also surpasses original, though the ps1 game has novel moments for its cheese factor. The only one downside is that the musical score is harder to notice. Had to tweak the volume to hear on TV. Seems like they customized audio to take advantage of speakers & headphones over TV.",0.011602418745275886,0.5085222978080121

 One of my favorite Resident Evil Games now. It has best from all series: Good Camera, Dangerously scary zombies, awesome enemies( Mr. X), creepy atmosphere and insane replayability. This game may appear short, you can finish it in 5 hours. But you will wanna finish it again on different difficulty or for a different character, there is good unclockables like in any decent RE game. Like games of PSX and Ps2 era it does not try to extend your playthrough by repetitive missions and artificial enemies increase.

166,guiletheguiles,9,"Maintaining the horrifyingly tense atmosphere of the first one and recreating everything from the ground-up, this is just as good as the original. The police station is the best part, since traversing through its dark halls and managing the ""Mr.X Factor"" becomes the highlight of the entire thing. On the sewers, thngs get a bit weird, but the interconected environments makes up for it. The pacing quickly gets back up when you reach the lab and the ending is just as incredible as it was on the PS1. Everything here feels fresh and new, yet extremely faithful to the original. I love how they kept the intensity of the combat system, forcing you to always be aware of your surroundings and always hope for more bullets and health items, while having just enough to get by.If you played the OG, you'll get a nostalgia trip, while drowning in the many surprises and twists that the campaign throws on you.The gameplay is good, albeit VERY difficult. I still don't think they managed to capture the magic of the ""over the shoulder camera"" as well as in RE4 or RE5, but what they did here was amazing. Backtracking doesn't feel as boring as in the original and its actually a fun and fundamental part of the game. Puzzles are fine and the ""AHA!"" moments make you look like a genius, even if things just happened naturally. I just wish it had less puzzles. It can break the ominous mood, sometimes.One thing that bothered me: I'm not in love the story. It suffers from the same problem that the first Remake did. I know that RE always had that ""B-Horror-Movie"" feel to it and I appreciate that it does that with quality, but couldn't they just... fix this? I LOVE the characters, but the writing feels bland! Claire and Leon's interactions were better on the original because there are almost none in here. Maybe it's the fact that OG handled the differences between A & B runs better.Also, this game is dark. Intentionally dark, but TOO DAMN DARK!As for the extras, I liked them, but not all of them. The Tofu and Hunk's scnenario were fun but Ghost Survivors just felt objectivelly hard, for no reason. I feel like these modes would've worked better if they added new crowd control movesets, like in RE4.

It looks stunning, the new 3rd person perspective works fine, levels, battles and puzzles were cleverly redesigned, it's more tense,  supporting characters were better developed...so many changes (for the better), but at same time it's feels very true to the original RE2 game.
 Each character campaign last about 6-7 hours. Some may say it's too short, but I'd rather have a short but amazing experience that keeps me coming back, than play something that drags on for 20 hours or so and never look back to it again.
 I have just a single complain about that Tyrant (Mr. X) that keeps chasing you for a great portion of the game. I know he's there to build tension and it works well at first, but starts to get annoying when you're trying to concentrate on a puzzle solving or exploring the environment and then this f* comes and forces you to run and abort everything you're doing.  It doesn't really damage the game and you get used to it, but I can't help feeling annoyed by his constant presence.

169,MaximumD,10,"Take an absolute classic game from the PSone era, and infuse it with today's tech while keeping the rest pretty much the same, and you've got a legendary release on your hands. This game is quite impressive from a technical standpoint and the team did a fantastic job of bringing the old settings to life in the time of full 3d. Just like the original, the atmosphere is chilling and supplies are scarce. Zombies once again pose a threat. Dark hallways are terrifying with the excellent HDR lighting.
 Small tweaks to the story flesh out the original tale but I like how they kept things as close to the original as possible with a just  few new additions and areas to explore. Updating MIster X to an unrelenting threat also is a plus as it ratchets up the tension to the max.
 However, if I had one gripe with this game, it's basically that there is no way to incapacitate Mr X completely. I think they could have made like a little puzzle where you set a trap for him and he's out until the next scripted event where he appears. Or if you choose the option of using exorbitant amounts of precious ammo to take him down maybe he could stay down until you get to the next area. It's a good trade off letting you decide how to play. Run and save ammo, or take him down for a while. They could've have just shown a little cut scene of him getting back up like in the original game, setting up the next sequence where he appears to make you poop your pants again. I think it's a great concept but it gets annoying when he constantly interferes with puzzle solving. It's less of an issue on a second play-through since you should be familiar with the map by then. It also barely makes sense that he doesn't chase you into certain rooms even though he clearly sees you enter them, like storage rooms.
 Honestly, this remake has exceeded my expectations in every way despite that minor flaw. It goes to show how old becomes new again. The design of this game was solid enough back when it came out to earn legendary PSone status. A fresh coat of paint shows why the original was so good, and with many QOL additions (like a map that updates as you go along), this game makes it hard to deny its excellence. Also, no bugs or glitches so far and a ton of extra modes to play through.

Ammo is scarce but the weapons are ludicrously satisfying, knocking meaty chunks out of the undead so even when they get up again (and again) they still don't feel like bullet-sponges. The voice acting is surprisingly good and the ambient dialogue is a nice addition. The puzzles are straightforward enough, and while the map automatically marking when a room still has secrets to give up can feel like cheating sometimes there's no denying it comes in handy.",0.22321428571428573,0.5696428571428571
171,Tyree09,10,"The nostalgia factor is huge with the release of Resident Evil 2 (Remake). The fans have clamored for this ever since the fantastic remake release of the original game back on GameCube in 2002. It may have taken almost a decade to arrive, but I'm glad they took their time. This game is amazing!
 First and foremost, the graphics are spectacular. Utilizing the full power of the current gen consoles, this game runs so smooth. The level of detail in the environments, especially the police station, really make it so you want to take your time as you explore that death trap. I also found myself taking aim at the various creatures in defense but waiting to pull the trigger because I was amazed at the realism of their animations.  When you play, notice how fluid the zombies move and take note at how their mouths move with every terrifying groan. It's amazing. Just don't stare too long or you'll end up with a high death count by the game's end.
 This game is a true re-imaging of the original. Without going in to any detail, they have taken the most significant parts of  Leon and Claire's original story, tweaked a few details, and produced a streamlined experience that will feel familiar and different at the same time. It's great knowing that while they didn't stray too far from the story and game-play of the original, it's just different enough that you don't feel like you're playing the exact same game 20 years later. They did a great job with the remake of the first Resident Evil and kept that same thought process with this game.
 This game almost got a 9 due to the length of the campaigns. I have only finished the main scenario of one character and was shocked by the completion time. I finished the campaign in under 10 hours  which was a bit disappointing when you think of other games that have main stories that take anywhere from 15-20 hours to finish. The score went back to a 10 when I rationalized that the replayability of this game is massive. Each character has their own main campaign that may take roughly 10 hours to complete, plus each have a ""2nd Run"" campaign which will show you what Character B was doing while you were playing the main campaign for Character A. If those side scenarios take even half the time of the main campaigns to beat you are looking at a 30 hour experience, at least. And there's a good chance you didn't find everything during your first play-through, so chances are you will tackle the campaigns again in short order.
 Resident Evil has been my favorite video game series since its debut. These remakes have definitely revitalized my interest  after a few missteps with the previous titles. Capcom scored a home run with this game in my opinion. Now is the time to begin the petition for an RE3 and Resident Evil Outbreak remake. If RE2 turned out this great I can't wait to see what they will have in store with future Resident Evil remakes.",0.006829268292682919,0.528841463414634
172,masseffectabc,9,"Ok. Let me take you back to my memory lane of how it begun my love with this franchise....
Ironically it was with RE2 for the ps1 back on 1998 and after putting the disk in my old ps1 everything in my life changed.
I was in love with this game, i was so much in love and obsessed that i beat it after the first day of having it. It was/is a masterpiece and then it begun my research of the franchise....
I backtracked playing RE1 which aside of having worst graphics i still loved the game so much and felt even more terrifing that RE2 being in the old decrepit Spencer Mansion.
Then i played RE3:N and loved it so much all the new little things they added to it and still felt like a survival horror game done right. Nemesis was freaking awesome. Following you everywhere you went. Making feeling you NOT SAFE ANYWHERE. Another masterpiece.
Then i bought the Sega Dreamcast  specifically to play RE:CV which i loved to the death (one of my favorites).
Then it came RE0 & Remake for the gamecube (which Re: Remake for me is the best Remake of all time) and i was jumping with joy of how well done both games where made.
And then came RE4. Which it was a very good game but it wasn`t a ""classic RE"", It was more action oriented and didn`t even had one jump scare or dread sensation in the entire game. Yes is a masterpiece but IS NOT A CLASSIC RESIDENT EVIL in all the sense of the word.
Then i bought my 360 (The Resident Evil 5 Bundle), and it was not only more of the same (regarding of RE4) but worst in a lot of points.
Then i played Resident Evil Revelations in my 3DS and loved the new direction they took the franchise but it still felt halfway through of what i wanted to expect from it or putting it simply in words what i wanted from a survival horror using the new camera and game mechanics. Still good but with a lot of room for improvements.
Then it came RE6 and OH MY GOD......What my beloved Capcom did to my franchise !? I was so angry, mad and i felt even more sad knowing that this game was still better than RE5 in a lot of ways.
That was the point when me (as a franchise fan) gave up on Capcom & Resident Evil. I felt so dissapointed by them that i knew the franchise was dead (at least at that time and for me).
Then it came RE: Revelations 2 which is fun, more horror but still had a lot of action and i felt it was not better than Revelations 1 but worst in almost every aspects. So i was like a drifter or hobo looking for shelter for my survival horror needs in other franchises that brought me joy but weren`t near in my heart as Resident Evil was. So i played my Dead Spaces, Fatal Frames, Silent Hills, etc.
Then i read that Capcom was making RE7 coming back to ""the roots of horror again"" so with the little hope i had left in my poor broken heart (blame that to Capcom & all RE games after Code Veronica) i bought and played Resident Evil 7 in my PS4. Loved the game, didn`t liked so much the first person view, i`m mora a third person fan but still a good game......BUT IT WAS NOT RESIDENTE EVIL in all the sense that word means. It had nothing to do with the main story/lore of the saga but still i felt that Capcom were trying to come back to the roots of what a true resident evil game should be.
And here we are now. You, me and my words after finishing my full playthrough of Leon(1) & Claire(2) and all i can say is this.....
THANK YOU SO MUCH CAPCOM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTEN TO YOUR FANS.
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LOVE THAT YOU PUT IN THIS GAME.
Still not perfect, i had some issues with it. Mainly with Ada playthought. SPOILERS: I hated that Scan Gun and everything that came with it. It cuts the pace of the entire game and it feels out of place in a story that is in 1998.
Aside of that minor concern everything else i perfect and how i dreamed (for years) of how it should be.
Now if there anyone from Capcom reading this, this is something i want to share with you of how i think you (Capcom) in general should approach the future games of the franchise:
1. Now that the engine (RE: Engine) is done and some assests of RE2: Remake will be used again in the remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis meka sure the game has the same felling that this Remake had.
2. Then proceed with the same treatment to Resident Evil: Code Veronica.
3. Then proceed with the same treatment to Resident Evil 0.
4. Then proceed with the same treatment to Resident Evil 1 Remake.
5. And then if you have the resorces and time Proceed with RE4, 5 & 6 but make them more survival horror than action and also redo all the story making it more coherent with the events of the previous games.
That is all, i hope you enjoyed the game as much a i did and can`t wait to pre-order Resdient Evil 3: Nemesis Remake !!!!
AGAIN......
THANK YOU CAPCOM !!!
I LOVE YOU......WITH ALL MY HEART & I MEAN IT.",-0.025868506493506496,0.5146872236186752

175,Wimpher,10,"What can I truly say here that hasn't been said already??? I mean, the praise this game is getting should already be enough. Hell, you probably don't even have to read this....you already KNOW this game is  absolutely without a shadow of doubt a masterpiece in survival horror. One of the easiest ""10's"" I have given out in recent memory. That is all that is required of me to say. RE is back with this one, and BY FAR the greatest RE game ever crafted. This thing sucks you in with its atmosphere like no other game this generation and I gotta tell you....when it's all finally over I had this sense of ""sadness"" like I just did not want this experience to end.
 Truly, truly remarkable gaming experience in every sense of the word. For me? Game of 2019, just barely edging out God of War.
 Now GO BUY IT if you haven't already. You should get a good deal on it now.",0.013888888888888874,0.5256944444444445
176,KayVen17,9,"Deutsche Review - Kritik Der folgende Test ist in 5 Kategorien zusammengefasst. Diese 5 Kartegorien ergeben die Gesamtpunktzahl von 0 - 100 Punkten. Um einen passenden Userscore zu geben wird auf oder abgerundet. Bei 84 Punkten ergibt das einen User Score von 8. Bei 86 einen von Userscore von 9. Falls eine 85 kommt entscheide ich ob ich es eher positiv oder negativ nehme. Regeln verstanden? Dann sind hier meine Punkte.
 Punkte: 92/100
 Pro:
 + grandiose Atmosphäre; Man ist sofort im Geschehen
+ die Anspannung durch den Grusel bzw. Survival-Horror bleibt bis zum Ende bestehen
+ einige Komponenten des Spiels machen das Spiel sehr unvorhersehbar und somit umso spannender
+ die Kampagne lädt zum erneuten Durchspielen ein (dank mehrerer Kampagnen)
+ die Steuerung ist einfach zu lernen; das Management ist einsteigerfreundlich
+ das Spiel schafft es bis auf den Final Boss durchweg gut gebalanced zu sein; man hat zwar eine Munitionsarmut, diese verhindert aber nie, dass man zu lange an einer Stelle feststeckt (getestet auf dem Standard-Schwierigkeitsgrad)
+ besonders gegen Ende ertönt ein sehr guter Soundtrack
+ das Spiel lief auf der Ps4 Pro durchgehend flüssig
+ bei beiden Spieldurchläufen sind keine Bugs aufgetreten
+ keine Spielabstürze
+ allgemein sieht die Grafik phänomenal aus
+ die Zombies sind fantastisch designed und reagieren sehr detailliert auf die Schüsse von Leon oder Claire
 Contra:
 - ich persönlich musste leider beim allerletzten Boss auf ""Assistiert"" stellen, da mein Munitionsvorrat zu gering war um das Spiel durchzuspielen.
- die deutsche Synchro schafft es die allgemein schon trashigen Dialoge (besser als im Original) noch trashiger zu machen (das kann man gut oder schlecht finden)
- leider wird zu schnell der ""einfache"" Schwierigkeitsgrad angeboten. z.B. sterbe ich bei einem Bossfight einmal und bekam direkt das Angebot auf ""leicht"" zu stellen. Andersrum bei einem anderen Boss (FINAL BOSS) starb ich sehr oft. Dort erschien das Angebot nicht einmal; [natürlich kann man es jederzeit manuell einstellen]",0.125,0.9166666666666666

178,barryburton,10,"Capcom have delivered the perfect modern Resident Evil game.  Graphics, sound and gameplay are perfect. However the beauty in this title is that they've retained that sense of claustrophobia, dread and tension from the original trio of games. The police station in particular is a masterpiece in puzzle design, an elaborate maze-like escape room. I also loved how they've combined elements of the Umbrella lab from RE1, RE2 and the first RE movie.
 As a video game it is also fantastic entertainment with huge replay value. You need to complete it at least 4 times to see it all and there are plenty of trophies and challenges to go for.
 It is genuinely frightening as well, especially when the tyrant is following you around. You know you've saved your progress, and that it's just a game, yet your heart will be racing and panic is just around the corner. It's amazing really.",0.14962121212121213,0.6325757575757576
179,VTL,9,Como fan de la version de PS1 de la seguna parte de la saga... esta fue dia de salida y no decepciono. Juego brutal sencillamente genial... es una gozada volver a Racoon City.,-0.875,1.0
180,VirgonoShaka,9,"Resident Evil 2 done again? Yes, and just like with the Remake of the original RE, Capcom hits it out of the park easily with this one. Not only the new engine makes the game look absolutely amazing, but everything in the game (sounds, music, dialogue, background, etc.) is carefully controlled to ensure a survival horror experience worthy of the title. Both campaigns are very well remade, with excellent moments in both, and plenty extra to keep you going back. If you are a fan of the classic RE, this game is a must, even if by being a remake it does have some moments that feel a little dated. Nevertheless, a excellent game and something to keep reminding us that Capcom can make good games when they put out terrible practices and eh games again.",0.05034271284271286,0.6287878787878788
